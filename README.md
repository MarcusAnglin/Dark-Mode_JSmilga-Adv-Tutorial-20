# Dark Mode

A React tutorial by [John Smilga.][john smilga]  
This is a course exclusive tutorial you can purchase [here][john smilga lesson]. The original tutorial repository is available for free [here][john smilga lesson git].

The rest of this readme is about my expectations before and my experience after completing the project. I would suggest using the links above if you're interested in learning about the project from its original creator.

## ::BEFORE.

#### what I expect.

This seems to be a simple tutorial where we toggle the styles on a page from a light theme to a dark one, I'm expecting lots of useState variables.

## ::AFTER

#### what stood out.

This project was very straight-forward, nothing stood out and I was able to see where we were going during the lesson.
